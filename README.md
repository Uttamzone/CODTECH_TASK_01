Overview of the Project
This project involves implementing and comparing different AI models on a dataset using various evaluation metrics.
The goal is to identify the best-performing model based on its ability to accurately classify the data.

Objective
The objective of this project is to:
Train and test multiple machine learning models.
Compare their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Provide insights into which model is the most effective for the given dataset.

Key Activities
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and test sets.
3. Implement multiple machine learning models.
4. Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics.
5. Compare the results to determine the best model.

Technology Used
Python programming language
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
